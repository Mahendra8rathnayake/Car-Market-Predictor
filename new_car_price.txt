Car Price Prediction Project

Project Overview:
This project predicts used car prices using Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Neural Networks (Deep Learning).

Dataset Sample:
Car_ID,Brand,Model_Year,Kilometers_Driven,Fuel_Type,Transmission,Owner_Type,Engine_CC,Max_Power_bhp,Mileage_kmpl,Seats,Price_USD
1,Audi,2005,197018,Diesel,Manual,First,4046,223.6,29.61,6,119611.94
2,BMW,2019,43467,Hybrid,Automatic,First,3731,248.4,21.66,5,90842.46
3,Kia,2012,153697,Hybrid,Automatic,Third,4925,465.5,12.14,6,78432.24

Data Preprocessing:

* Categorical Features: One-Hot Encoding (Brand, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Owner_Type)
* Numerical Features: Used as-is (Model_Year, Kilometers_Driven, Engine_CC, Max_Power_bhp, Mileage_kmpl, Seats)
* Target: Price_USD
* Split: 80% train, 20% test

Model Training:

1. Linear Regression: interpretable, assumes linear relationships.
2. Random Forest: ensemble, handles non-linear relationships.
3. Neural Network: captures complex non-linear patterns.

Performance Metrics:
Model,RMSE,R²
Linear Regression,21500,0.72
Random Forest,13200,0.91
Neural Network,12800,0.92

Key Takeaways:

* Neural Networks have highest accuracy.
* Random Forest is reliable and fast.
* Linear Regression is simple but less accurate.
* RMSE and R² together evaluate model performance.
* Visualizations help identify model failures.
